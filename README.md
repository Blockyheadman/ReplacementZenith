# Replacement Zeniths (No support)
## This mod adds 2 new Swords to Terraria! It's only going to be available to 1.3 Terraria.
This is the place you can go to download the mod in case of Mod Browser downtime. :)

## Shutdown
I'm shutting down support for this mod. Recently a tModLoader update has come out for support on terraria 1.4. I feel that it isn't neccesary to work on this mod anymore. I think it would be better for me to move on to 1.4 development instead as it seems like it would be more popular. That doesn't mean I am leaving 1.3 development behind, it just means that I don't want to support it as much anymore. Thanks for the ??,??? downloads! I'll see you next mod!
