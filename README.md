# Replacement Zeniths (Ended support)
## This mod adds 2 new Swords to Terraria! It's only going to be available to 1.3 Terraria.
This is the place you can go to download the mod in case of Mod Browser downtime. :)

## Shutting down
I'm shutting down support for this mod. Recently a tModLoader update has come out for support on terraria 1.4. I feel that it isn't neccesary to work on this mod anymore. I think it would be better for me to move on to 1.4 development instead as it seems like it would be more popular. That doesn't mean I am leaving 1.3 development behind, it just means that I don't want to support it as much anymore. I'm also leaving the source code for this mod in case people want to fork it and make adjustments to weapons and add more features. Thanks for the 8,000+ downloads! I'll see you next mod!
