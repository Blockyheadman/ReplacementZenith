Welcome to Replacement Zeniths! (Also adds (useless) grass block!)
This Mod adds 2 new Swords to Terraria! It's only going to be available to 1.3 Terraria. (I'll probably make a different version for 1.4 once TModLoader gets the update)
The 2 new swords are: TerraMere & MeowBlade.
If you couldn't tell by the names, once the 2 most powerful swords are put together, they can make a stronger version of both of them!
There's 2 versions of them to suit your liking on projectile. (Or look)
The blade itself can tell you what projectile it shoots. For example, TerraMere shoots Meowmere projectiles out.
Hope you like it!! :)
